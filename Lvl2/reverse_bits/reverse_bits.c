writing them into reversed from left to right.

Step by step example:

ITERATION 1:
-> Let's start from octect = 4 (00000100)

-> reversed << 1 shifts everything one place to the left, creating
   one free space on the right (0 * 2 = 0)

-> octect & 1 takes the LSF of octect (0) and returns a byte with
   only the LSF


-> The bitwise OR compares reversed 00000000 and octect 00000100

-> now this result (00000100) is assigned to reversed

-> >>= assignes the new shifted value (00001000) to octet (4 * 2 is 8)

reversed = 00000000
octet = 00001000 (This is 8 in decimal, indeed 4 * 2)

ITERATION 2:

-> We start from octect = 8 (00001000)

-> reversed is still 00000000 (0 * 2)
